I'm currently working on TASK-4, which involves deploying a web application on AWS. I began by creating an AWS account and then accessed the AWS Management Console. From there, I navigated to IAM, created a role for the EC2 service, attached the AmazonS3FullAccess policy, and named the role "Website-EC2." After that, I launched an EC2 instance using the Amazon Linux AMI and selected the t3.micro instance type, ensuring I connected it to the previously created role. I also modified the security groupâ€™s inbound rules to allow SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80), and HTTPS (port 443), and launched the instance with the default settings.
Next, I created an S3 bucket named "myportfoliositeresume" and uploaded my web application files to it. Following that, I set up Route 53 for DNS management. To connect to the test application, I referred to online resources and used the command "ssh -i 'my-key.pem' ec2-user@16.171.145.106." Once connected, I executed commands such as "sudo yum update -y," "sudo yum install httpd -y," "sudo systemctl start httpd," and "sudo systemctl status httpd." After confirming that the Apache HTTP server was running, I accessed my portfolio at "https://myportfoliositeresume.s3.amazonaws.com/task1.html," successfully completing the deployment.
