Semantic HTML tags - for example, header, section, and footer are used in the construction of this portfolio site for clarity and structure. The head contains my name, title, profile picture, and navigation links to all the various sections. This clean responsive design uses CSS with a soothing color palette and crisp fonts. Some of the key content sections include an "About Me" intro, a showcase of three projects, technical skills with hovering effects, and detailed work experience. Additional interactive features which make up the experience of a visitor include smooth scrolling between sections and visibility animations. The site's bottom line section is known as the footer; it is not always defined, but typically, it will include copyright information or other links.
