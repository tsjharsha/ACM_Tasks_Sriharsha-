Hi! So, I am working with deploying a pretty simple smart contract from the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity but am new to blockchain. So I really used Google to assist me through coding and connecting to MetaMask. I initially found that the Ropsten test network has been removed, so I ended up choosing the Sepolia ETH network instead.
I created a file named SimpleToken.sol in Remix IDE and after the code runs with no errors, I installed the MetaMask extension on Chrome, set up my wallet, and connected to the Sepolia Ethereum network. I got around 0.15 ETH from the faucet of Sepolia and have been trying to deploy the contract for nearly a week now.
I've attached the Injected Provider WEB-3 and tried varying gas limits between 500,000 and 3,000,000, as well as initial supplies of 10, 100, and 1,000. However, each time I try to deploy, it fails and claims "gas transaction failed," even though many simple contracts only need 0.1 ETH for the deployment process.
